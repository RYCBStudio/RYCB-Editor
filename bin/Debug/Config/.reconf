[Run]
# This sets whether the IDE uses runtime compilation.
# *runtime compilation: IDE will run the python script to check errors instead of just compiling it.
# NOTICE: Runtime compilation uses more memory and will find more runtime errors,  including user-raised custom exceptions
#         (i.e. "raise Exception" will also be included). Besides, when using turtle lib, IDE will always use compilation 
#         check because each time the script runs, the turtle window will show and cannot close.
# NOTICE: When you run the python script, IDE will automatically check errors again. And this pre-running check will also
#         check runtime errors, so you can set this to false trustingly.
# Accepted Value: true, false
# Recommend Value: if you still worry about runtime errors cannot be found, set this to true. Otherwise, keep it false.
